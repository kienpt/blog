[Strawberries again top 2018's 'Dirty Dozen' fruits and veggies](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/health/2018-dirty-dozen-fruits-and-veggies-ewg/index.html). 
Well, I am growing my own straberry this summer and want to share the process in this post.
First, I summarize some basic information about straberry plants, then I will update how my plants grow.

Straberry plant

![](https://i2.wp.com/bonnieplants.com/wp-content/uploads/strawberry-plant-Illustration-web.jpg)

__Life cycle__: 5 - 6 years life of span with about 3 productive years. They die in the winter and grow back in Spring.  
__Temperature__: 60F - 80F (15C - 26C). Perfect time to start is the mid of April.  
__Light__: direct sunlight, 8 hours/day. It is the best to place it outdoor.  
__Water__: daily.  
__Soil__: pH 5.5 - 6.8, well-drained soil, rich in [humus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humus). I have no idea how to pick soil with this characteristics though.  
__Fertilizer__:  
__Root size__: 8 - 10 inches depth. So a perfect pot should have height of 8 - 10 inches.  
__Straberry type__: Junebearer, day neutral and everbearer. The last two produce less runners and have longer season of harvest but produce smaller berries.  
__Propagation__: seeds or runners. Seeds are probably cheaper but they take longer time to grow. As a beginner, I go with runners, so I also don't need to worry about how to sprout the seeds.  
__Tips__:
+ Clip off the runners if you want the plant focus on the fruits.  
+ Clip off the first flowers if you want bigger fruits.
+ Never burry the crow.
+ Water more during fruit bearing season.
