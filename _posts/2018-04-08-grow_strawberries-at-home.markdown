Although my apartment is tiny, it does not stop me to grow my own 'garden'. I want to produce my own straberry this summer and also want to share the process.
First, I summarize some information about straberry plants, then go through my preparation for growing it. Later I will update how my plants grow
and finally the results - hopefully some fresh fruits and lessons learnt.

Straberry plant
---------------

__Life cycle__: 5 - 6 years life of span with about 3 productive years. They die in the winter and grow back in Spring.  
__Temperature__: 60F - 80F (15C - 26C). This means we should start to plant straberries at the mid of April.  
__Light__: direct sunlight, 8 hours/day. It is the best to place it outdoor.  
__Water__: 1-2 inches of water, daily.  
__Soil__: pH 5.5 - 6.8, well-drained soil, rich in [humus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humus). I have no idea how to pick soil with this characteristics though.
__Fertilizer__:  
__Root size__: 8 - 10 inches depth. So a perfect pot should have height of 8 - 10 inches.  
__Straberry type__: Junebearer, day neutral and everbearer. The last two produce less runners and have longer season of harvest but produce smaller berries.  
__Propagation__: seeds or runners. Seeds are probably cheaper but they take longer time to grow. As a beginner, I go with runners, so I also don't need to worry about how to sprout the seeds.  
__Tips__:
+ Clip off the runners if you want the plant focus on the fruits.  
+ Never burry the crow.
+ Don't plant where tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, or eggplant have been grown recently because they are all prone to Verticillium Rot. I don't even know what Verticillium is but it must be a bad thing.
+ Avoid overhead watering.
+ Water more during fruit bearing season.
