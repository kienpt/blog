Inspired by a blog post about [`think about your career`](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-think-about-your-career-abf5300eba08), written by Julie - VP of Design at Facebook, I try to project myself in the next five years.
I focus on the the skills that, I think, are important to advancing my career, especially ones that I am currently weak at or have little experience.
- Lead a big open-source project (e.g., PyTorch)
- Feel natural and be myself in public speakings
- Explain ideas, questions and reasonings concisely.
- Focus, yes after 30 years I still need to learn how to focus.
